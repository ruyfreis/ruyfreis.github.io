# Welcome (_Bem-Vindos_) [<span>&#x1f1e7;&#x1f1f7;</span>](index.md)

Ruy Freitas Reis holds bachelor's degrees in Exact Sciences (2012), Computer Science (2013), and Computational Engineering (2014) from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF). He also earned a masterâ€™s degree (2014) and a Ph.D. (2018) in Computational Modeling from the same institution. He is currently a professor in the Department of Computer Science at UFJF.

His research interests include computational modeling, bioheat transfer, computational immunology, finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods, Monte Carlo-based methods, as well as distributed and high-performance computing.
